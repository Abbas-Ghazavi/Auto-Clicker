# Random Mouse Clicker (AC)

This is a simple Python script that simulates mouse clicks at random coordinates on the screen.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pynput library

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```
    pip install pynput
    ```
## Usage
1. Run the script `AC.py` using Python.
2. While the script is running, you can toggle its activity by pressing the space bar. Pressing 'space' again will resume the script, while pressing 'esc' will stop it entirely.
3. The script will continuously generate random mouse clicks within a specified range of x-coordinates and a fixed y-coordinate.

# Notes
- Be cautious when running the script, as it simulates mouse clicks and can interact with whatever is on your screen.
- It's recommended to run the script in environments where its actions won't interfere with important tasks.
